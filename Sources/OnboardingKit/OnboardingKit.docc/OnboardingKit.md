# ``OnboardingKit``

OnboardingKit is a Swift SDK that helps you create onboarding experiences in `Swift` and `SwiftUI`.


## Overview

![OnboardingKit logo](Logo.png)

OnboardingKit is a Swift & SwiftUI SDK that helps you create amazing onboarding experiences.

OnboardingKit has different onboarding types. A standard ``Onboarding`` is shown at once, and only once, while other types can require multiple presentation attempts, a certain number of "incorrect" actions, etc.

OnboardingKit has powerful components like ``OnboardingPageView`` and ``OnboardingSlideshow`` and an ``OnboardingScreen`` container that can present any onboarding flow with additional controls.
