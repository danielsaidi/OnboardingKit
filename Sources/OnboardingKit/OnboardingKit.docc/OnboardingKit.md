## Overview

![OnboardingKit logo](Logo.png)

OnboardingKit is a Swift & SwiftUI SDK that helps you create amazing onboarding experiences, with granular control over presentation.

OnboardingKit has different onboarding types. A standard ``Onboarding`` is shown at once, and only once, while other types can require multiple presentation attempts, a certain number of "incorrect" actions, etc.

OnboardingKit also has localized utilities, like the ``LocalizedOnboarding``, and UI components like ``OnboardingPageView`` and ``OnboardingSlideshow``.
