# Release notes

This project honors semantic versioning, with the following strategy:

* Deprecations can happen at any time.
* Deprecations are removed in `major` updates.
* Breaking changes should only occur in `major` updates.
* Breaking changes *can* occur in `minor` and `patch` updates, if the alternative is worse.

Beta version tags are removed after the next minor or major version. 

These release notes only cover the current major version.
